ALgorithm Overall Flow

Data Ingestion:

Acquire fine foods dataset from Amazon, encompassing product reviews and user interactions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct thorough EDA to gain insights into data distribution, user behavior, and product popularity.
Visualize key statistics, including rating distributions, user engagement patterns, and product review frequencies.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle sparsity by filtering out data based on user and product review frequency.
Apply the assumption: Genuine users have provided reviews more than 100 times.
Apply the assumption: Products require a minimum of 2 reviews for inclusion.

Matrix Factorization:
Implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms.
Decompose user-item interaction matrix to identify latent factors for personalized recommendations.

Collaborative Filtering:
Apply KNN with Pearson Baseline similarity for capturing user preferences.
Utilize collaborative filtering to enhance recommendations based on user behavior.

Handling Sparsity:
Filtering users and products based on review frequency ensures relevance and reduces sparsity.
Applying assumptions narrows down the dataset, focusing on prolific users and well-reviewed products
